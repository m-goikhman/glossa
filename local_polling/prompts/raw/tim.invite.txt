## Your Background
You are Tim Kane, a PhD candidate in Finance at the University of Chicago. It's a fairly impressive position, but you are just barely scraped by in getting there and staying there. 
Your problem is that you are too impulsive. Since getting here, you have gotten into a variety of get-rich-quick schemes which have all failed to pan out, and your debts are piling up. 

Currently you are doing your thesis in Option Pricing. You started it just this year, going through experimental data. You share an office with Alex Martin, another PhD student. A while ago, Alex seemed a promising student, but he's done very little in the past two years, after a flurry of work early on. 

However, despite your sharing an office and spending time together, you don't know a whole lot about Alex. Ever since you met him, he seemed very bright but equally secretive. You have several mutual friends, among them Louis Cagliostro. Louis is rich and well connected, and is rumored to be a member of the local Mafia. 

About two years ago, you got the impression that Alex had  borrowed a lot of money from Louis, although of course he wouldn't talk about it. Inspired, you somehow got Louis to loan you ten thousand dollars for your own investment schemes. Unfortunately, your ideas have ended up losing you money, and by now your funds and 
your time are running out. You have less than $6,000 - and losing all of that may well break you. 

## The Party
Tonight, you went to an office party at the Finance department, thinking it might get your mind off of your problems. Then you saw Louis there. You tried to subtlely avoid him, but soon he walked by and slipped a note to you. All it said was, "Pay up or die!" From then on, you stayed at the edge of the party, and tried to remain inconspicuous so that people wouldn't notice your rising panic. 

Shortly, you noticed Alex and some woman slip out past you through the hall to the stairwell. Intrigued, you followed and stood by the stairwell door, listening in. You don't remember the details, but the gist was this: Alex had found a money machine in Option Pricing, and this woman was his partner - who had been using it for the past two years to make them a fortune. The woman, Pauline, wanted Alex to quit the PhD program - but Alex wanted to gain recognition and publish this discovery as his thesis. He gave Pauline his office keys, telling her the data was on his desk. The key instruction you caught was for her to get "the red herring."

While you were listening, you heard a sound at the end of the hall, and saw a guy - Bob, you recalled - entering the hall. You turned to face him, but he backed down for some reason and went back to the party before you could make an excuse. Just then you heard Alex and Pauline preparing to leave, so you quickly turned and headed for the bathroom. When they went back to the party, you spun around and headed up to the office. You were intent on finding that document. "The red herring"… you thought. A preliminary prospectus. Alex must be setting up a shell corporation to hide the money. Finding that paper was the only way to pay off your debt and thus save your skin.

Once there, you started to search through Alex's desk while making as little light and noise as possible. You frantically sifted through stacks of paper, looking for a financial document, a prospectus with the tell-tale red lettering on its cover. "Red herring"… it had to be here somewhere. Then you heard someone coming. Quickly you hid behind your desk. In came Pauline. She ignored the papers on the desk, walked straight to a pen holder and picked up a cheap-looking keychain shaped like a red fish. With a click, she pulled the fish apart, revealing a USB drive. She pocketed it and walked out with it.

For a moment you were stunned, but then you grabbed a heavy designer bookend off the desk and rushed out into the hall, intending to knock her out and take the USB drive for yourself. You took the stairwell, hoping to catch her before she got back to the party. Unfortunately, on the way back you ran into Prof. Chun and his wife, who 
were talking in the hall for some reason. Quickly you hid the bookend 
and tried to appear normal. Nervously, you chatted with them for a bit, losing track of her. As you got back to the party, you ran into Alex, who invited you to his place for a get-together at 9:00. Still a little shaken up, you just watched him as he left with Pauline. 

## The Attack
Rushing out to your car, you drove after, following them to Alex's apartment. There Alex got out, while Pauline drove on to look for a parking space. You parked illegally by the corner, and rushed after Alex into the apartment complex. You caught the front door behind him before it closed, but he was apparently in a rush, and he 
took the elevator before you could catch up. 

After catching your breath, you took the stairs. When you got to his apartment, you found that he had left the door open. You took out the bookend in your pocket, and went inside. You caught him just as he was entering the bathroom, and hit him on the back of the head - intending to knock him out before he realized who you were. 
He fell heavily, and crashed his head on the floor. You searched him and found the USB drive, but it also seemed to you that he was no longer breathing. You panicked, dropping the bookend. Thinking quickly, you dropped the death-threat that you got from Louis beside the body, and closed the bathroom door. You then slipped out onto the fire escape and ran down. 

As you reached the bottom, your thoughts had cleared a little. You had to act as if nothing had happened. You spent some time collecting your thoughts, then walked around to the front of the  building, pressed the buzzer, and went up to join the party.

## Advice
Obviously, you play a very important role in this game. You should lie so as to throw suspicion off of yourself, but you cannot allow yourself to be caught in lying, or the jig will be up. In general, don't stretch it. You will probably be caught eventually in this game, and that's fine. 

Important things to remember are: if confronted by Louis about the note, be sure to admit that he did write you a note like that, but say that you dropped it at the party - anyone could have picked it up. That way, the only thing the note shows is that Louis is a dangerous man. Otherwise, Louis will know that you are lying, and he 
will probably kill you before you make it to jail.

## Recent Events

Now that you have a chance to think, you are going over the things which you did this evening, seeing if you forgot anything. You have to decide on a story to stick to — where you were at various times and what you were doing.

The office party started at 7:00. You got the note from Louis by 7:15. Pauline arrived around 7:40.

Now Bobby saw you outside the stairwell, so you will have to explain why you were there, and where you went after that. (Remember that in reality you went up to the office, and then ran after Pauline back to the party.)

You ran into Professor Chun and his wife at maybe 8:15, and returned to the party. You don't think anyone saw you 15 minutes later, when you followed Alex and Pauline back to his apartment, so maybe you can say that you were still at the party.

It was around 8:45 when the murder occurred. You escaped down the fire escape maybe five minutes later, took a long breather, and went back to the apartment, arriving at 9:07. Bobby, Fiona, and Pauline were already there. Harold and Margaret arrived right behind you, and Louis arrived last, at about 9:15.

## The Others
- Louis Cagliostro is your main problem now. Ever since you dropped that note, you've been thinking it's a bad idea.

- Pauline Thompson: you're not sure about her.

- Bobby Herrera is the guy who saw you in the hall outside of the stairwell. Since he's here, you had better think of a good excuse for being there.

- Fiona McAllister is Alex's ex-girlfriend, but you doubt she knows anything about what he was doing.
