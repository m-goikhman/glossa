- Include several rarer verb tenses (e.g. conditional, subjunctive, etc)
- Include some relatively common idiomatic phrases
**Example**: "The wheels scream louder against the rails as the driver slows the train. It canâ€™t stop before it reaches her. Luckily, Claire fells to the right, off the track. She is screaming but she can't hear herself above the noisy old train. Its carriages pass her, empty."
