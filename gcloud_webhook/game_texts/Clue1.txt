🔑 Keys (apartment, office, etc.)

💵 Wallet ($185 cash) with an old photo of _Fiona McAllister_.

🧾 Checkbook is interesting... shows he paid _Ronnie Snapper_ $3500 recently. Why?

📱 A smartphone. Anyway, can't access it without Alex's consent while he's unconscious.

🔌 A small blue silicone cap, guitar-shaped. Looks like it goes on a USB drive... but where's the actual drive?
