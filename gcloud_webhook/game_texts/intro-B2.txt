It's Friday evening, December 18th. Chicago's skyscrapers loom through the fog, their windows glowing softly against the early winter darkness. Holiday lights twinkle faintly in the mist, reflecting off the wet pavement below. The lake wind carries that sharp December bite, and you can smell snow coming.
You remember December evenings from childhood -  kitchen warm with the smell of hot chocolate, counting down days until Christmas morning. Now December 18th means overtime shifts, not holiday excitement.
While the rest of the city is getting ready for the holidays, you have no time for festive shopping or parties. As a rookie detective with the Chicago Police Department, you're about to begin your first major case.
