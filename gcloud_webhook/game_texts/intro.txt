🎙️ _The emergency call comes at 8:52 in the evening.
They say there might have been an attack, so you arrive with the paramedics.
You step into the apartment just as they take the victim out on a stretcher.
A young woman, close to tears, says his name is Alex Martin.
He is about twenty‑eight and studying for a PhD.
He is alive but unconscious._

_The door closes behind you with a soft click.
Now you are alone with the other guests, and nobody says a word.
You are the detective here.
It is up to you to discover what really happened._
