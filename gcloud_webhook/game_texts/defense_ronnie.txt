😎 Ronnie: "Seriously, detective? I arrived last, at 9:10. 
Ask anyone! And that blue Honda on the corner - that's not mine. 
I drive a Tesla, if you haven't noticed. Alex was a good investment - why would I hurt someone who pays me back reliably?"

💭 _He's right. Several people confirmed he arrived last.
And indeed, whose Honda is that parked illegally outside?_

❌ This is not Ronnie. I have **1 more attempt** left.
