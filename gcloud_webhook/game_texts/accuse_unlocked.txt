🎙️ *You have now examined all the evidence and spoken privately with every suspect.*

A new option is now available in your Game Menu: **Make an Accusation**.

Choose wisely - you have **2 attempts** to identify the correct suspect. If you accuse someone incorrectly, they will defend themselves and give you clues, but if you're wrong twice, the real attacker will escape.

There's no time limit, so feel free to review everything before making your decision.
