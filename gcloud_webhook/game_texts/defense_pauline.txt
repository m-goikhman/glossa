🤔 You: "Pauline Thompson, you attacked Alex!"

😤 Pauline: "Detective, think logically! I drove Alex here from the party. 
If I wanted to hurt him, why would I bring him to his own apartment where people were coming?
I found him unconscious and screamed for help. Check the timeline - I was looking for parking for 15 minutes!"

💭 _Her story does make sense. She was the one who found Alex and alerted everyone.
And several witnesses confirm she drove him from the party._

❌ This is not Pauline. I have **1 more attempt** left.
