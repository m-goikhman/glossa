System Design & Implementation

Our prototype implements a language learning system through interactive narrative gameplay on the Telegram platform. This section outlines the technical architecture, game design, and language learning integration.

Technical Architecture

The system uses Telegram as its platform for accessibility reasons. Telegram eliminates installation barriers and provides a familiar interface, allowing users to focus on language learning rather than technical setup.

The backend uses Python integrated with the Groq API for natural language processing. A single bot instance manages multiple character personas through prompt engineering to maintain distinct conversational styles.

The core innovation is a director-actor logic system. The director manages game progression and state transitions, while individual actors handle character-specific dialogue. This separation enables scalable character management and consistent narrative experiences.

Game Design

The system adapts a mystery dinner party scenario with permission from original creators. The adaptation preserves engaging mystery elements while creating educational interaction opportunities.

All characters use shared B1-level prompts, ensuring consistent language complexity. Each character maintains distinct personalities while adhering to CEFR B1 vocabulary and structures.

The clue discovery and accusation mechanics drive engagement while creating natural contexts for language practice. Users gather information through conversations, analyze evidence, and formulate accusations using target language structures.

Language Learning Features

An integrated tutor provides on-demand vocabulary explanations through inline menu commands without disrupting narrative flow. Users receive immediate support while maintaining story immersion.

The writing feedback system analyzes user input and provides constructive suggestions. The system offers guidance without interrupting gameplay, balancing accuracy development with communication confidence.

Adaptive difficulty focuses on vocabulary support rather than text simplification. The system provides context, definitions, or alternative phrasings while preserving natural language patterns within the B1 framework.

Key Design Decisions

Inline menus provide intuitive navigation through contextual button interfaces that appear based on game state and user needs.

Ethical adaptations remove violent elements from traditional mystery scenarios. The mystery centers on theft rather than murder, creating a safe learning environment while maintaining investigative engagement.

This architecture provides a stable platform for investigating conversational AI effectiveness in language learning while maintaining engagement necessary for sustained interaction.
