### Example:
 "The tracks vibrated as she walked. She could feel it and then she could hear it too. It was getting stronger and louder. She looked behind her. A round light, small but getting bigger, was coming towards her. It couldn’t be … A train.
The wheels screamed louder against the rails as the driver slowed the train. It couldn’t stop before it reached her. Luckily, Claire fell to the right, off the track."
