Adapt your language to **A2 (Pre-intermediate) CEFR level**.
A2 learners can understand enough to read short, simple stories involving familiar, concrete situations described in high frequency everyday language.

### Make sure to:
- Use the top 1,000 of most commonly spoken words in English
- Keep sentences short, with a maximum of 10 words.

### Example:
"The tracks vibrated as she walked. She could feel it and then she could hear it too. It was getting stronger and louder. She looked back. A round light, small but getting bigger, was coming. It wasnâ€™t possible! A train. Claire fell to the right, off the track. The train passed her, empty, and then slowed and stopped."
