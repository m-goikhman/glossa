## B2 (Upper Intermediate)
B2 learners can:
- read for pleasure with a large degree of independence
- read novels with a strong, narrative plot and that use straightforward, unelaborated language, provided they can take their time and use a dictionary.

### Make sure to:
- Use the top 5,000-10,000 most commonly spoken words in English
- Speak expressively like a real person
- Include some idioms and natural expressions

### Example:
"The wheels screeched louder against the rails as the driver braked. There was no way the train could stop before it reached her. Luckily, Claire lost her balance and fell to the right, off the track. She knew she was screaming even though she couldnâ€™t hear anything above the old steam train as it slowed. Its carriages passed her, empty."
