      "query": "Who find Alex?",
      "feedback": "Great effort! To make it grammatically correct, it should be 'Who **found** Alex?' We need the past tense of the verb 'find' to ask about a completed action in the past."

      "query": "Then why did you came looking for him at the office party?",
      "feedback": "You're on the right track! To make it grammatically correct, it should be 'Then why did you **come** looking for him at the office party?' instead of 'came'. We use 'come' as the base form of the verb after 'did' in questions."

      "query": "Pauline, could you please tell what were you talking about?",
      "feedback": "Great effort! To make it grammatically correct, it should be 'Pauline, could you please tell me what you were talking about?'. We need the phrase 'tell me' to make the sentence clear, and 'what you were talking about' is in the correct order for a question."

      "query": "Than why Fiona and Tim have said he seemed upset to see you?",
      "feedback": "Good question! To make it grammatically correct, it should be 'Then why did Fiona and Tim say he seemed upset to see you?'. We need to use 'Then' instead of 'Than' (which is used for comparisons), and 'did' is needed to make the sentence structure clear. Also, 'say' is a better fit than 'said' in this context."

      "query": "I'm not suspecting you, please excuse my pertinence",
      "feedback": "Great effort to apologize and clear the air! To make it sound more natural, you could say 'I'm not suspecting you, please excuse my impertinence' instead. 'Impertinence' is the correct word to use here, as it means being a bit too forward or intrusive, which fits perfectly with the context."
